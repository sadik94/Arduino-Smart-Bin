# Arduino-Smart-Bin
This project is a Smart Dustbin system built using an Arduino and an ultrasonic sensor. The dustbin automatically opens its lid when it detects an object (like a hand) nearby, providing a hands-free, hygienic way to dispose of waste. Ideal for smart home or automation projects, it demonstrates basic IoT principles and sensor-based control.
